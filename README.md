# prone

Better exception reporting middleware for Ring. Heavily inspired by
[better_errors for Rails](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors).

See it to believe it:
[a quick video demoing Prone](https://youtu.be/Fgv6bxmxxpM).

Prone presents your stack traces in a consumable form. It optionally filters out
stack frames that did not originate in your application, allowing you to focus
on your code. It allows you to browse environment data, such as the request map
and exception data (when using `ex-info`). Prone also provides a debug function
that enables you to visually browse local bindings and any piece of data you
pass to `debug`.

## Install

Add `[prone "2021-04-23"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

This project no longer uses Semantic Versioning. Instead we're aiming to never
break the API. Feel free to check out the [change log](#change-log).

## Usage

- **with lein-ring**

  Using `lein-ring` version `0.9.1` or above, add this to your `project.clj`:

  ```clj
  {:profiles {:dev {:ring {:stacktrace-middleware prone.middleware/wrap-exceptions}}}
  ```

- **without lein-ring**

  Add it as a middleware to your Ring stack:

  ```clj
  (ns example
    (:require [prone.middleware :as prone]))

  (def app
    (-> my-app
        prone/wrap-exceptions))
  ```
  
  Please note, with this configuration you should make sure to
  [only enable Prone in development](#should-i-use-prone-in-production).

- **with pedestal**

  See [prone-pedestal](https://github.com/eunmin/prone-pedestal)

- **with catacumba**

  See [catacumba-prone](https://github.com/funcool/catacumba-prone)

## Debugging

Whether you've tripped on an exception or not, you can use Prone to debug your
application:

```clj
(ns example
  (:require [prone.debug :refer [debug]]))

(defn myhandler [req]
  ;; ...
  (let [person (lookup-person (:id (:params req)))]
    (debug)))
```

Calling `debug` without any arguments like this will cause Prone to render the
exception page with information about your environment: the request map, and any
local bindings (`req` and `person` in the above example).

You can call `debug` multiple times. To differentiate calls, you can pass a
message as the first argument, but Prone will also indicate the source location
that triggered debugging.

`debug` accepts any number of forms to present in a value browser on the
error/debug page:

```clj
(debug) ;; Inspect locals
        ;; Halts the page if there are no exceptions

(debug "Here be trouble") ;; Same as above, with a message

(debug {:id 42}) ;; Inspect locals and the specific map
                 ;; Halts the page if there are no exceptions

(debug person project) ;; Same as above, with multiple values

(debug "What's this?" person project) ;; Same as above, with message
```

## Q & A

### Should I use Prone in production?

No. You would be exposing your innards to customers, and maybe even to someone with
nefarious purposes.

Here's one way to avoid it:

```clj
(def prone-enabled? (= "true" (System.getProperty "prone.enable")))

(def app
  (cond-> my-app
          prone-enabled? prone/wrap-exceptions))
```

You can chain more optional middlewares in this `cond->` too. Pretty nifty.

### How does Prone determine what parts of a stack trace belongs to the application?

By default it reads your `project.clj` and looks for namespaces starting with
the project name.

You can change this behavior by passing in some options to `wrap-exceptions`,
like so:

```clj
(-> app
    (prone/wrap-exceptions 
      {:app-namespaces ['our 'app 'namespace 'prefixes]}))
```

All frames from namespaces prefixed with the names in the list will be marked as
application frames.

### How do I skip prone for certain requests?

Pass a predicate function `skip-prone?` to `wrap-exceptions`. For example, to
exclude Postman requests check for `postman-token` in the headers:

```clj
(-> app
    (prone/wrap-exceptions 
      {:skip-prone? (fn [req] (contains? (:headers req) "postman-token"))}))
```

### What about AJAX requests?

Yeah, that's a bit trickier. There's no point in serving a beautiful exception
page when you have to inspect it in devtools.

The prone response includes a `Link` header with a `rel=help` attribute. Like this:

```
Link:</prone/d97fa078-7638-4fd1-8e4a-9a22576a321f>; rel=help
```

Use this in your frontend code to display the page. Here's an example from one
of our sites:

```clj
(def rel-help-regex #"<(.+)>; rel=help")

(defn check-err [result]
  (if-let [url (->> (get-in result [:headers "link"] "")
                    (re-find rel-help-regex)
                    second)]
    (set! js/location url)
    (do (js/alert "fail")
        (prn result))))

(defn GET [url params]
  (go
    (let [result (<! (http/get url {:query-params params}))]
      (if (:success result)
        (do-some-successful-stuff)
        (check-err result)))))
```

#### A little trick

The latest prone error page can also be found under `/prone/latest`, so if you
haven't fixed your frontend code to use the `rel=help` header quite yet, you can
always go there to check it out.

### I'm getting double printing of error messages

Yeah, I guess you already have a logging framework to print errors for you? And
then prone goes and prints them as well. Turn it off like so:

```clj
(-> app
    (prone/wrap-exceptions 
      {:print-stacktraces? false}))
```

## Known problems

- We have not yet found a way to differentiate `some-name` and `some_name`
  function names by inspecting the stack trace. Currently, we assume kebab case.
- Using a middleware to always load the Austin `browser-connected-repl` for
  ClojureScript causes JavaScript errors that partly trips up Prone
